### API Keys and Configuration

This project requires API keys. Follow the official Streamlit guide for [Secrets Management](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app/secrets-management).

1.  Create a new directory named `.streamlit` in the root of your project.

2.  Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`.

3.  Add your API keys and URLs to `secrets.toml`:
    ```toml
    [api_keys]
    coinmarketcap = "YOUR_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY"
    gemini = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

    [api_urls]
    cmc_latest_listings = "[https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest](https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest)"
